The IEEEMEC SB website is a collaborative venture between the IEEE SB and the FOSS community at Model Engineering College, Kochi.

It is built and run by the student community at the college under the Mentorship program within which students with the interest to learn and build skills are matched with mentors with expertise and vision from communities associated with the program and are guided by the goals of FOSSMEC, to build OpenSource, GPL/MIT Licensed products that help build the contributions to FOSS among MECians.
